All rights t’ the booty be stayin’ with their rightful captains. Ye shan’t copy, spread, tinker, plunder the innards, nor craft knock‑offs ’less the articles o’ law or these terms say ye may, an’ ye best not use the Code in ways that flout the law or steal another’s treasure.

This Code be given “as be,” with nary a warrant o’ merchantability, seaworthiness, speed, or fitness for any charted course—spoken or unspoken.

By usin’ the Code, ye swear:

    Ye alone be responsible for how ye wield, share, or hack the Code an’ whatever wondrous or cursed things it spits out.

    The coders, scribes, deck‑hands, an’ licence‑holders be not liable fer any wrecks, losses, or mutiny that come of yer use or misuse o’ the Code.

    Ye’ll not turn the Code toward unlawful, scurvy, or pilferin’ deeds.

Ye sail with this Code at yer own peril.
If these terms sour yer grog, haul anchor—use it not, copy it not, share it not, nor twist it to yer liking.
